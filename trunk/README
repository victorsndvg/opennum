OPENNUM
-------------------------------------------
OpenNum lets you distribute solvers with a nice graphical interface 

Typically, to program a GUI is time consuming and requires experience with 
graphic libraries. OpenNum lets you create a graphical interface adapted to 
your solvers by simply editing an XML configuration file. More specifically, 
OpenNum lets you
 · to collect a hierarchical dataset,
 · to call any executable file and
 · to visualize scalar and vector fields, plot graphs or show simple plain 
 text files.

It also has other useful utilities specifically designed for numerical 
simulation packages:
 · it permits to manage a centralized materials dataset;
 · it can read several finite element mesh formats and several field formats.
