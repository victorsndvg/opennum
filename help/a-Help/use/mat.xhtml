    <h3>Materials database</h3>
    <p>The materials database can store the physical properties of a set of materials that are relevant for the applications.</p>
    <p><span class="rev"><strong>The materials database could not appear if the distributor of the package decides that it is not necessary for his applications</strong>.</span> When it appears, the materials database can accessed from the menu item <span class="menu">Materials database</span>, located in the right end of the menu bar (such position strengthen the fact that the materials database does not depend on a particular application).</p>
    <p>The user can add, delete and modify the materials stored in the database. Every modification is recorded in a copy of the original database, located in the <a href="../conf/ident.xhtml#fold">user HOME folder</a>. The submenu item <span class="menu">Reset</span> restores the original database located in the installation folder. Please be aware that a modification in the materials database will affect to the existing working folders whenever their simulation is re-calculated.</p>
    <p>The physical properties of each material and their definition depends on the package distributor. Please refer to the distributor's help to know the details.</p>
